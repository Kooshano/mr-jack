# Contributing

## Setup

1. Build the project:

```bash
make build
```

2. Run locally:

```bash
make run
```

## Guidelines

- Keep changes scoped to a single concern.
- Update `README.md` when behavior or commands change.
- Do not commit generated files from `bin/` or `state/`.
- Preserve existing game rules unless your change explicitly targets rules.

## Pull Requests

Include:

- What changed
- Why it changed
- How you tested it
